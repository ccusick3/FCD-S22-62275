This is an example project in the FCD S22 repo. It is meant to demonstrate the correct format and content expected for uploading materials. This area is used to reiterate the project description from my M6 submission. I could also describe the M6 prompt.

**Contents**

- `.pdf` of M6 submission
- additional `.gifs` or animated content
- `FCD_V6.gh` script file
- `.3dm` CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe and placement of planels on facade. You must have Rhino 6 to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.
